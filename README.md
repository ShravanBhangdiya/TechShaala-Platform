## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or Atlas)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory with the following:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-lms
PORT=5001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Cloudinary (for media uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# PayPal (for payments, use sandbox keys or leave as mock for dev)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
PAYPAL_SECRET_ID=your_paypal_secret_id
```

> For development/testing, you can use dummy values for PayPal and Cloudinary, but real uploads/payments require valid credentials.

### Installation

Open two terminals (one for backend, one for frontend):

#### 1. Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Running Locally

#### 1. Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally (or update `MONGO_URI` for Atlas).

#### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

#### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- **API Base URL:** The frontend (`client/src/api/axiosInstance.js`) is configured to use `http://localhost:5001` for API requests.
- **Port Conflicts:** If port 5001 is in use, change the `PORT` in your `.env` and update the frontend base URL accordingly.
- **Database Seeding:** You can add courses manually via the instructor dashboard or by writing a script (see deleted scripts for reference).
- **Category Mapping:** Ensure course categories in the database match frontend IDs (e.g., `web-development`).
- **Mock PayPal:** For development, payments are simulated; use real credentials for production.

---

## ü©π Troubleshooting

- **Cannot GET /auth:** The backend is an API server; use POST requests to `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`.
- **Registration/Login Fails:** Ensure all required fields are filled and the backend is running. Check the browser console and backend logs for errors.
- **MongoDB Connection Error:** Make sure MongoDB is running and `MONGO_URI` is correct.
- **CORS Issues:** Ensure `CLIENT_URL` in `.env` matches your frontend URL.
- **Images Not Uploading:** Check Cloudinary credentials in `.env`.
- **Payments Not Working:** For real payments, set valid PayPal sandbox credentials in `.env`.
- **Category Filtering Not Working:** Ensure category IDs in the database match those used in the frontend.
